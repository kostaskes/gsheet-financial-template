## üí° Why I Built This

I created this template with **small business owners** in mind, particularly those who might not have the budget for expensive accounting software or the time to maintain and support it.

The goal is to offer an **affordable and easy-to-use solution** that streamlines the process of tracking finances, without the need for technical expertise or ongoing costs.
